-------------

This application uses dynamic css and html powered by javascript- while pulling from frameworks such as Bootstrap and Bulma to make the app responsive and modular- provides a unique experience for the social drinker:

Once legal drinking age of the user has been confirmed, **The Tipsy Tarot** generates both a randomized Tarot Reading and Cocktail Recipe for the user based on their inputed criteria utilizing two supporting application programming interfaces.

*Behold your future!*

Gif here to demo app
